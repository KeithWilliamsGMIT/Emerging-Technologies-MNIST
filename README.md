# Emerging-Technologies-MNIST

This repository contains the solutions to the second problem sheet on the MNIST dataset, given as part of my fourth year [emerging technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/) module in college. Note that the solutions to these problems were written in Python 3.5.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate to the root of the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/KeithWilliamsGMIT/Emerging-Technologies-MNIST.git
cd Emerging-Technologies-MNIST
```

Next, download the following files from the [MNIST website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) into a folder called data in the root of the repository.
+ training set images (9912422 bytes) 
+ training set labels (28881 bytes) 
+ test set images (1648877 bytes) 
+ test set labels (4542 bytes)

Finally, use the following command to run the solution.

```
python3 mnist-reader.py
```
